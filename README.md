# RememberMe

# Setup
- Download the project folder from GitHub

- Run the command to install the npm packages
`npm i`
- Run to auto build the dev files
`npm build-dev`
- Run to setup webserver
`npm start`

# TO DO
https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserverserver
check out why the webpack dev server is depreciated.

# Guide
- For the prototype code should be written in index.js 
- By running the dev and prod commands webpack 'packs all the html, css and js into either dev or dist directories
- dist/ is what the netlify server reads from 

# NOTES
It seems to be allowed to use the NFC permissions on android
you need a valid and signed https request, have been testing
by using netlify's domain 
`forgetmenotbox.netlify.app`
